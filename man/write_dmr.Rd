\title{Generate files from a set of DMR}
\usage{
write_dmr(dmr_table, path, qvalue_thr = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{dmr_table}{A data.frame generated by [find_dmrs].}

\item{path}{A string including absolute or relative path which prefixes are added to
("_hyper.bed", "_hypo.bed", ".seg")}

\item{qvalue_thr}{A numerical threshold. Report only DMRs with a fdr
lower than threshold.}
}
\value{
Nothing. Only saves output tables.
}
\description{
For a quick visualization using a genome browser like IGV, this function
generates [BED](https://bit.ly/1hdVNjA) and [SEG](https://bit.ly/2J2WZdZ)
files of statistically significant hyper-methylated and hypo-methylated
DMRs.
}
\details{
BED files (hyper- and hypo-methylated DMRs separately) report genomic
location and fdr (in form of -log10(q)).
SEG files report average beta differences between tumor and normal/control
samples at each DMR.

NOTE: BED files have 0-based coordinates while SEG files have 1-based
coordinates.
